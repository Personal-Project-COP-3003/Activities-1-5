# Activities 1-7

## What I will be doing throughout the 7 weeks: 
  I wil be making sure the elements flow well, and making sure the app looks visually appealing.

## Week 1:
  I will complete lesson 1 of the Android Kotlin Fundamentals course. The first lesson is learning how to build your first app. 
  
### What I accomplished in week 1:
  #### 1.0: 
    I spent 1 hour downloading the Android Studio.
  #### 1.1:
    I spent 30 minutes getting the files to load in and for Android Studio to load in properly.
    
    I spent 2 hours and 30 minutes downloading the virtual devices for Android Studio and trying to get my 
    phone to connect to the debugging system. I have not succeeded yet and will need to do some research on 
    how to make my phone connect to the debugging system. 1 hour later I was able to get my app running on my
    phone! If you have an LG device, you need to go to https://lg-support-tool.en.lo4d.com/windows and download
    the .exe file. Once that is downloaded, load the .exe file and hit install usb driver. You will need your
    phone's model number for this (found in settings > about phone > hardware > model number). Select the correct
    model number and hit install. This will make Android Studio recognise your device. After I unplugged my phone
    from the USB, Android Studio no longer recognises the device. I switched over to a samsung device which is
    recognised regardless of how many times you unplug it. 
    
  #### 1.2:
    I spent 45 minutes to make a dice rolling game. I have two buttons. Roll - is simulating rolling dice with 
    numbers 1 - 6. The count up button adds one per button press to the dice number.
    
  #### 1.3:
    I spent 1 hour getting the dice images to show up, getting the gradle file to sync, changing the dice colours
    and making a reset button which makes the die disappear. 
  
  #### 1.4: 
    I spent 1 hour reading through the tutorial. It had us use a new project to load in a nav bar and a explore
    the code. It then wanted me to read through and play with the sunflower app. I did this, however I did not
    want to override my current project.

## Week 2:
  I will complete lesson 2 of the Android Kotlin Fundamentals course. This lesson is about layouts and how to make your app user friendly.
  
### What I accomplished in week 1:
  #### 2.1:
    I spent 1 hour reading through the tutorial. I added a button to the dice rolling game to switch to the
    new about me section of the app. I will be adding more to this section and will be trying to add
    images to this section.
    
  #### 2.2: 
    I spent  1 hour reading through the tutorial. I was able to add the nickname field.
