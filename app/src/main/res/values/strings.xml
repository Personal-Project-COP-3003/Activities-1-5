    <string name="bio">I have worked retail for over two years now. I started
        as a cashier at JCPenney on 25 May 2017 and stayed there until 20 October
        2019. I then switched to Bass Pro Shops on 26 October 2019 and am still
        working there at this time. \n I am a Third year at FGCU in the Software
        Engineering department. I am very interested in Graphic Design and Web
        Design as well. \n \n In February 2019 I attended MangoHacks
        at FIU. At MangoHacks (A hackathon in Miami Florida), my team, VR Stim,
        got best use of SnapKit in our program. We decided to use VR to create a
        "safe place" for people to enter when they are feeling depressed,
        stressed or anxious. There are four walls full of things you have
        liked from different social media platforms. There is music that
        plays to help keep you calm. And you have your 3D bitmoji to react
        with you. \n \n This semester in Software Engineering Fundamentals, I worked
        together with five other members to create a car rental service. The group
        is called Metal Pandas. I am proud of this work, as the logo was hand made
        and there was a complicated system we had  to work with. \n \n Thank you for
        reading my bio!</string>
